Fuzzing (Sutton et al. 2007) is currently the most pop-
ular vulnerability discovery technique. Fuzzing was first
proposed by Barton Miller at the University of Wisconsin
in 1990s. Conceptually, a fuzzing test starts with gen-
erating massive normal and abnormal inputs to target
applications, and try to detect exceptions by feeding the
generated inputs to the target applications and monitor-
ing the execution states. Compared with other techniques,
fuzzing is easy to deploy and of good extensibility and
applicability, and could be performed with or without the
source code. Besides, as the fuzzing test is performed in
the real execution, it gains a high accuracy. Whatâ€™s more,
fuzzing requires few knowledge of target applications
and could be easily scaled up to large scale applications.
Though fuzzing is faced with many disadvantages such
as low efficiency and low code coverage, however, out-
weighed the bad ones, fuzzing has become the most effec-
tive and efficient state-of-the-art vulnerability discovery
technique currently.
